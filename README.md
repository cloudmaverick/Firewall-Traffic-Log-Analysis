# Firewall-Traffic-Log-Analysis
This Project is being developed for organization. We track all the traffic on our firewall. From log file we get the information about which user or machine access the particular websites on our network and visualize the all information in the form of graph. We store the log information in TitanDb. Using gremlin query language we perform different query on it and show result in the form of graph. We use gephi tool to show graph.
